ezRPG 1.0 Simple
=====

A modular game engine written in PHP, originated by Zeggy.
This is simplified version, with only basic functionality and easy to understand source code.
Core's own functionality can be expanded by user-written modules. Some of them are already included in the package.

If you aim for more rich core functionality and some major changes, try [ezRPG 1.2.x](https://github.com/ezrpg/ezRPG-1.2.x)
However, compatibility between this two versions are not guaranteed, since this one version counts as a legacy one.
