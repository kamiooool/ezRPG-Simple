NOTICE!
=====
The "master" branch here currently serves as a developer one, so please be patient and wait till the RC will be released. You MAY download and use this version at any time, however I am not guarantee it to be working :) As of September 2013, master branch counts as a fully and stable working RC.

29 Dec, 2013: Multilingual smarty support added. Now your engine can be fully translated into any language, using only one file (same goes for plugins, simply add to global.lng all the needed strings).

ezRPG 1.0.2 Simple
=====

A modular game engine written in PHP, originated by Zeggy.
This is simplified version, with only basic functionality and easy to understand source code.
Core's own functionality can be expanded by user-written modules. Some of them are already included in the package.

If you aim for more rich core functionality and some major changes, try [ezRPG 1.2.x](https://github.com/ezrpg/ezRPG-1.2.x)
However, compatibility between this two versions are not guaranteed, since this one version counts as a legacy one.
